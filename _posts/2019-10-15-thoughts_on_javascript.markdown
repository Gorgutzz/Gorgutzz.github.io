I have finally completed the Javascript section of the course. This section was quite chellnging as I found JS to be more difficult to grasp compared to ruby. Me being completely new to JS, I was a bit surprised at the similarities it shared with C and C++ which I dabbled with a few years ago.

The abstraction quality of languages like C, JS etc. was always something I had difficulty with, especially when more advanced functions and callbacks were thrown into the mix. The use of higher-order functions (functions that accept other functions as arguments) and closure scope (the identifiers available at the location of a function definition are available when the function is invoked elsewhere, were tricky concepts to wrap my head around.

Additionally, most JS is written with  a server-side environment in mind such as Node JS, which implements a rather large library, on top of core JS, or a client-side environment with a web browser, which implements various Web APIs, with a huge variety in terms of functionality options. Add onto the that, the large number of 3rd-party packages available via npm for both environments and there's just a massive amount of information that could be used for any sort of project.

Conclusion -

Learning all these very imporatant JS fundamentals and redoing alot of the section was  very beneficial to me as I was 2/3 done when the v8 of the cirriculum came out. Iâ€™m excited now to start my JS and Rails API project and am hopeful that I could play around with some of the more advanced concepts I mentioned as well as the backend and frontend in a creative way
