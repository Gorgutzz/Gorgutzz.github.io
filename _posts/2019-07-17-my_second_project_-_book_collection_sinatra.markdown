The second project required to program an Active Record  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app. I used the resources that were provided to get an idea of how to structure the app..My idea was to track and display books since I am an avid reader and a fan of books. It would have a simple user authentication system along with a menu where you could view all the books listed so far, add new ones or look and edit the book's details.

I watched some of the videos and looked at the examples which gave me inspiration for  how I want to structure my app.. I make use of helper methods in a helper class in my controllers as I find it makes the code more readable and neat.

Example of the Helpers being used: ![](https://i.imgur.com/8On9k06.jpg)

The most time consuming part of the project was the structing of the erbs and the stylesheet. While html and css are supposedly easier to code, it took me a while to sort it out. Another thing which took a while to figure out was what kind of picture to use for the site's background and the colors of the text. 

Here is how the menu of the site looks: ![](https://i.imgur.com/40I3Qka.png)

I was quite satisfied with the look of the site with these colors. This was an interesting project to do and I got to make a working site for the first time with a working login systme no less.
